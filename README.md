# odin-recipes

This project will be entirely in HTML, simply making an index.html page, and multiple linked pages through relative paths. Hoping to demonstrate an understanding of HTML tags and attributes, relative paths, images, paragraphs, and lists.

Project finished. Linked 3 recipe pages to index page, added images, links back to index, and lists.
